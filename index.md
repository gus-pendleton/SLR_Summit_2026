This is a custom curriculum which uses data from the Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve 
to teach data visualization with ggplot2. This lesson was developed by Augustus Pendleton, but 
draws on material adapted from lessons by the University of Michigan Carpentries.
While it is based on The Carpentries curriculum and teaching practices, 
it is not officially overseen by The Carpentries organization. 
We welcome any feedback or questions to us through 
[GitHub](https://github.com/gus-pendleton/SLR_Summit_2026). 

The curriculum is developed for complete beginners interested in 
learning reproducible data science techniques and data visualization. For more details, please see 
[Introduction to the Workshop]({{ page.root }}/00-intro). 

This lesson is a subset of a larger, two-day workshop which includes data cleaning,
RMarkdown, and basic statistics. We encourage learners who enjoyed this lesson 
to view these additional lessons [here](https://marschmilab.github.io/Cornell_Carpentries_Curriculum/index.html).
